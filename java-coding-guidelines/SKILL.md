# Java Coding Guidelines

Core rules from Alibaba Java Coding Guidelines v1.7.1. Apply when writing, reviewing, or refactoring Java code.

| Section | Reference | When to Read |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Naming | `references/naming-conventions.md` | Naming classes, methods, variables, packages, constants |
| OOP | `references/oop-conventions.md` | POJOs, equals/hashCode, inheritance, casting |
| Collection & Concurrency | `references/collection-concurrency.md` | Collections, thread pools, locks, concurrent utilities |
| Exception, Logging & Control | `references/exception-logging-control.md` | Exceptions, logging, control flow |
| Format, Comments & Structure | `references/format-comments-structure.md` | Formatting, comments, project structure |
| Unit Test & Security | `references/unit-test-security.md` | Testing, security |

## How to Apply

### Writing New Code
Read relevant reference → follow naming → apply OOP rules → handle exceptions & logging → write tests.

### Reviewing Code
Read reference for each area → verify rules → categorize: **Mandatory** (must fix) / **Recommended** (should fix) / **Reference** (nice to have).

### Refactoring Code
Fix Mandatory first → naming consistency → thread-unsafe patterns → exception handling & logging.
